# audio-editor
An audio editor I am developing.

Currently it can only play multiple audio clips continuously (in sync).

UI support via GTK will be added later, this is just the core part of the editor. I am planning to add track support in the coming weeks. Effects, cut-copy-paste, undo-redo is still left. I will add these features as I keep learning!

PS: Please don't judge me for my atrocious code quality! I plan to simplify things further once I get the hang of it.
