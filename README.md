# audio-mixer
An audio mixer I am developing.

Currently it can only play tracks (a track is a group of clips).

UI support via GTK will be added later - this is just the core part of the editor. Effects, and undo-redo is still left. I will add these features as I keep learning!

Goal next week: Get the hang of OpenAL and simplify code further.
